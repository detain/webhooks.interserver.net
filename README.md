## GitHubWebHook
`GitHubWebHook.php` accepts, processes and validates an event,
it also can make sure that the event came from a GitHub server.

Functions in this class are:

#### ProcessRequest()
Accepts an event, throws `Exception` on error.

#### GetEventType()
Returns event type.
See https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events for a list of events.

#### GetPayload()
Returns decoded JSON payload as an object.

#### GetFullRepositoryName()
Returns full name of the repository for which an event was sent for.

#### ValidateHubSignature( $SecretKey )
Retuns true if HMAC hex digest of the payload matches GitHub's, false otherwise.

#### ~~ValidateIPAddress()~~
Returns true if a request came from GitHub's IP range, false otherwise.
âš  Use `ValidateHubSignature` instead.

### Errors

hrows `NotImplementedException` when you pass an event that
is not parsed anyhow, and throws `IgnoredEventException` for
`fork`, `watch` and `status` events which are ignored by design.
